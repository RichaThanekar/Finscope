## Common Questions

**Q: Why is my coverage gap so high?**
A: The 10x income rule ensures your family can maintain their lifestyle for 10+ years even without your income.

**Q: What if I can't afford the recommended coverage?**
A: Start with term insurance (cheapest), and gradually increase coverage. The tool shows your additional premium capacity.

**Q: How is Critical Illness cover different from Life Insurance?**
A: CI pays you while you're alive if diagnosed with covered conditions. Life insurance pays beneficiaries after death.

**Q: Should I include my spouse's income?**
A: No, calculate separately for each income earner, then sum the coverage needed.

**Q: What about inflation on premium?**
A: Term insurance premiums are typically fixed. The inflation impact is on your living expenses and coverage needs.
